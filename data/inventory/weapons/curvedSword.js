export const label = "Curved Sword";

export const description = `The curved sword (or “backsword”) is
not a single sword but an entire category. The blade features a mild-to-deep curve, and is generally only sharp on the outer
edge. The original curved design was meant to be used by
riders upon horseback. Warriors found the curved weapons
to be better weighted than straight blades toward uneven,
roughshod fighting. Atop a horse, any iota of imbalance
could send a knight or soldier toppling off his steed and to
the ground, which was tantamount to a death sentence.
Ancient versions of the curved sword include the
Indian talwar, the Persian shamshir and the Greek makhaira. More modern versions include the cavalry saber, used
prominently in conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars and
used ornamentally in the American Civil War.
The curved sword is a poor thrusting weapon, but excels when slashing or chopping. The weapon provides a +1
bonus when chopping downward from a position of height,
as if upon horseback. Although modern characters might
not frequently swing the sword while upon a charging steed,
other situations may grant the bonus. A character attacking
from an open truck door or a stairway may find that the
weapon is suitably balanced for such a vantage point.`;
