export const description = `A mace is little more than a metal club, usually consisting of a reinforced shaft with a metal head
(sometimes studded). Although the mace has a history
that goes back all the way to 12,000 BC, this weapon
didn’t see prominent use until the Middle Ages. Armor
was designed then to help a knight withstand attacks
from bladed weapons. The damage from blades, axes and
arrows was more easily nullified with chain or plate mail.
Although a mace certainly could not pierce armor, the
mace did crush the chain mail enough to allow for blunt
trauma to a knight’s body. Where an arrow would simply
bounce off, the mace could still, on an off-chance, break
bones or crush heads.
Another curious piece of history about the mace is its
occasional use by medieval clergy. Canon rule forbade priests
from drawing blood. A mace, on the other hand, doesn’t
precisely spill blood — damage can theoretically be delivered
to an enemy without ever spilling a drop. Apocryphal stories
(sometimes in tales from the Battle of Hastings or in poems
like the “Song of Roland”) from this time period tell of priests
wading into a battle, maces at the ready.`;
