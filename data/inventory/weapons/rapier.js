export const label = "Rapier";

export const description = `A rapier’s dual-edged blade, easily three feet
in length, is poorly balanced for slashing. The weapon
instead makes small cuts — little slices, really, more
demeaning than damaging — in an opponent. When the
time comes for the kill, the swordsman thrusts forward
and runs his adversary through with the point.
It was for this reason that the rapier saw little
battlefield experience. Historically, the rapier was the
weapon of the wealthy, a sword of distinction marking
one’s own influence and affluence. Some called this
sword the espada ropera, the Spanish dress sword, as it
mostly hung by a man’s side as ornamentation. A man
only unsheathed the sword during fencing matches or
duels, and rarely were such duels to the death. Those it was a sliver of flesh taken from the back of a hand or
a slash through the adversary’s cheek. The rapier has
fallen out of usage, even in modern fencing (see “Fencing Swords”). Still, some elder or traditionalist vampires
carry their rapiers with them during events of pomp and
circumstance, just in case they need to embarrass some
upstart with a quick whisper of the flashing blade.
Two more battlefield-savvy versions of the rapier are the estoc and the Panzerstecher (or “ArmorStinger”). All rapiers have a point sharp enough and
a blade thin enough to pierce armor, and thus have
Armor Piercing 1.`;
