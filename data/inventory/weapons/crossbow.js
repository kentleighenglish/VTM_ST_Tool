export const description = `Crossbows come in varying sizes, from onehanded hand crossbows that fold down to Size 1/J to heavy
arbalests capable of piercing a metal plate. A character may
use either Athletics or Firearms to fire a crossbow. Reloading a crossbow takes a number of turns equal to twice its
minimum Strength.
Repeating crossbows saw use in China as siege weapons

of heavy crossbow bolts and is operated by rapidly cranking
a lever, which pulls back the string as the next arrow drops
into place from a gravity-fed magazine atop the weapon.
The repeating crossbow is capable of short and medium

internal magazine.
Every crossbow has the Armor Piercing effect: 2 for
a normal crossbow, 1 for a hand crossbow or repeating
crossbow and 4 for an arbalest.
