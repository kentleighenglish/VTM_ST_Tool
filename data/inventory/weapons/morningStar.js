export const description = `The morning star is a heavy mace.
Topping the weapon is a ball adorned with a series of
sharp metal spikes or needles. When the morning star
hits open flesh, the weapon doesn’t just break bones,
it also scores flesh from the bones. The morning star
has gained two curious nicknames over time. The first
(goedendag) is a Dutch word meaning “nice day.” The
second (holy water sprinkler) is because most morning
stars look similar to the aspergillum, a Catholic device
used in the dispersion of holy water.
The Kindred of the Lancea Sanctum make use of
aspergillum morning stars. The pious vampires use the
device during ritual ceremonies to dispense sacred Vitae
(dipping the aspergillum in an urn of blood, then shaking
the morning star over the congregation), and also use
the weapon to battle their enemies.`;
