export const description = `The long sword, or broadsword, was
the most common weapon on the battlefield in the midto-late Middle Ages, up until the inclusion of artillery
and the arquebus. The long sword is perhaps the most
basic of swords: a single-handed, double-edged blade
approximately three feet in length. This sword could
be used to slash or chop (design elements left over from
early sword-making), but the point allowed for wielders
to thrust with it, as well. Thrusting allowed a warrior
to make his attacks more effective against armor that
could absorb slashing or hacking blows`;
