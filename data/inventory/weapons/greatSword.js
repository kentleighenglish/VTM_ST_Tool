export const label = "Great Sword";

export const description = `The generic term “great sword” likely
derives from the Scottish two-handed long sword known
as the claymore. And even that term is an Anglicized pronunciation of the weapon’s true name: the claidheamh mór,
which, sure enough, is Gaelic for “great sword.” It’s a heavy
weapon (about seven pounds) and long (blade of four feet,
hilt just over a foot). The great sword is meant to be held
with two hands. Using it one-handed is particularly difficult,
and requires a Strength of 4 to manage.
This blade was used for a timeframe of about 300 years,
starting in the 13th century, though the great sword didn’t
see prominent use until the latter end of that period. Warriors
wielded the claymore and used the brutishly long sword to
upend knights from horses, smash shields and take off heads at
their unprotected necks. True claymores from the late medieval
period are rare and highly prized. They exist mostly among old,
aristocratic collections seldom seen by the public.`;
