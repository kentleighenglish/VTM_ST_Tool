		It governs how much weight a character can lift, how
		much he can physically push, and how hard he can
		hit another character or object. The Strength Trait is
		added to a characterâ€™s damage dice pool when he hits
		his opponent in hand-to-hand combat. It is also used
		when a character wishes to break, lift, or carry something,
		as well as when a character tries to jump a distance.`
