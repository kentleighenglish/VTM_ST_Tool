export const label = "Manipulator"

export const description = `You have always been fascinated by others. Why do people behave as they do? What thoughts and emotions affect their actions? The cognitive processes that influence the choices people make intrigue you. Sometimes just asking people questions about their actions can yield important information, but often people do not truly understand their own motivations and concerns. In these cases, it is far easier to set up situations - experiments, if you will - to see how people behave. You attempt to manipulate these situations for your personal advantage, in order to discover more information about your chosen subjects. Some might call these experiments cruel, but to you it is mere scientific necessity.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you manage to set up an incident or situation that allows you to gain new insight into your subject's psyche.
Ban: Never refuse a chance to manipulate or gain further insight into a target.`;
