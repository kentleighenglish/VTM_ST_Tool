export const description = `It's a strange world out there, and you're determined to find out more about it. Whether it's esoteric subjects like alchemy or the geography of the parallel dimensions, or more "worldly" matters like the interactions of various magics or the creation of ephemera, you have keen insights into the matter. You may not be willing to reveal all the tricks of your trade, but you enjoy the accord you receive as a student of the great unknown. Other affairs can wait so long as there is new spirituality or metascience to hold your attention.
Quest: Whenever you develop a new theory about supernatural phenomena and get a chance to test it out, you gain Willpower. Storytellers should be judicious in awarding Willpower only for shocking new discoveries, and not everyday developments in a character's mystical life.
Ban: Never resist a chance to dabble in the mysteries of the world, even if you risk your life for it.`;
