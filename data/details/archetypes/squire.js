export const label = "Squire"

export const description = `Rather than stepping into the limelight, you prefer to support and help those who do. You are Tonto to the Lone Ranger, Watson to Holmes, Kato to the Green Hornet. You care nothing for glory or recognition, but merely seek the chance to be a small part of the process. You abide by the words of your present hero, and no task is too menial for you if your hero requests it.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever you play a supporting role in an accomplishment, but take no credit for it.
Ban: Never contradict or undermine your current heroic companion.`;
