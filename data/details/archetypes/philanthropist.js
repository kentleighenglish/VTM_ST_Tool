export const label = "Philanthropist"

export const description = `You have a highly defined sense of morality and always strive to do the "right" thing. This invariably consists of helping others and doing good deeds without the expectation of reward. You may base your ethical code on your belief in a higher morality (i.e. some divine source), or it may just spring naturally from within you. Your ethics are rational and logically consistent (at least you believe they are). You are forever balancing your actions against your system of beliefs.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you make a positive difference in someone's life.
Ban: Never accept a reward for your generosity. Never cause deliberate harm to an innocent.`;
