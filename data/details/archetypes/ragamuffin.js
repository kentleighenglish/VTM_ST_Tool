export const description = `The opposite of the Fop, you believe that substance is all that matters; therefore you play the militant slob to show how truly deep you are. You reject all such "surface ephemera" as bathing and basic grooming. Those who pay attention to such trivialities are affected snobs and beneath you. Just because you are a slob doesn't mean that you are really any deeper for all that. Those who see past your grimy exterior and really take the opportunity to know you may well find you no more genuine than the Fop.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you expose another person as a fraud.
Ban: Never dress appropriately for an occasion.`;
