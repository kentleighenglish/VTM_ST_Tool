export const label = "Stoic"

export const description = `You take the unavoidable sorrows (and joys) of life in stride. You have a calm and serious mind, and rarely give into unseemly displays of emotion. This does not mean that you do not have feelings, you just do not wear them on your sleeve. The most people will ever get out of you is a slight smile or a small frown. Some Stoics have fierce malcontent sides that they hold back for years, passionate whirlwinds which explode out when they have finally borne all they can.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you come through an emotionally charged situation with your composure intact.
Ban: Never let your emotions get the better of you.`;
