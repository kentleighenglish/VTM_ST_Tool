export const label = "Fiend"

export const description = `You inflict pain for no other reason than the enjoyment you get out of watching others suffer. You are, in short, a sadist. You may have a hundred facile reasons for why you do what you do. Maybe you have really tried to stop, but the feeling of power that you get out of controlling others destinies always draws you back. You only feel truly alive when someone else is screaming in pain or begging for mercy. You live in fear that someone may give you what you really deserve. You should consult the Storyteller before taking this archetype.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower every time you really hurt someone.
Ban: Never pass up an opportunity to inflict pain.`;
