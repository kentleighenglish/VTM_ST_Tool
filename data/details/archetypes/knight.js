export const label = "Knight"

export const description = `A present day Don Quixote, you never tire of tilting at windmills. You follow all the old codes of chivalry and seek to aid those in need. This makes you an oddity in the modern world. You may be a true idealist, and somewhat naively, believe the best about everyone. You may be a pragmatist, desperately trying to keep a small portion of the world from sinking into despair. You may even have been raised with a strict code all your life which you latch on to unswervingly, and will not desert simply to suit your own ends. In any event, you believe that one person can make a difference.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower every time following your code may put you at risk.
Ban: Never behave in a manner that does not befit a Knight.`;
