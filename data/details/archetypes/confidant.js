export const label = "Confidant"

export const description = `You understand people and, more importantly, you like them. You are a facilitator who listens and advises. People confess to you and in return you give them advice, most of which is good (though sometimes your advice is more for your own benefit than for that of the recipient). You are very interested in other people, and who and what they are. Personalities fascinate you, as do the sickness and beauty of human nature.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone confides in you on a personal and intimate level.
Ban: Never deny a chance to learn more about another individual.`;
