export const label = "Freak"

export const description = `Unlike the Grotesque or the Riddler, there is something genuinely wrong with you. Perhaps you jabber to yourself in insane, made-up languages, or are perpetually silent, never speaking to anyone. Touched by lunacy or divine inspiration, your mind is a seething realm of chaos that you can barely understand, and you act out accordingly. You alarm others with your words and deeds, though they are sometimes quite profound.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever others are shocked or scared by your strange ways, especially if you accidentally hit on an alarming new insight.
Ban: Never resist letting your madness slip the leash and run free, expressing your strange notions about the world in actions and words.`;
