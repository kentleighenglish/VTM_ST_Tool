export const label = "Pedagogue"

export const description = `You know it all, and desperately want to inform others. Whether through a sense of purpose or a genuine desire to help others, you make sure that your message is heardâ€“ at length, if necessary. Unlike the removed Sage, you are more than willing to lecture those who lose their way. You may be a well-meaning mentor, or a verbose blowhard who loves to hear yourself talk. You are unlikely to sit idly by as others make the mistakes that you made, though you may not necessarily have the answers to suit their problems.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone benefits from wisdom that you have imparted to them.
Ban: Never miss an opportunity to instruct someone in the proper manner of doing something (though you may do so politely, embarrassing them serves no real purpose).`;
