export const description = `The pursuit of pleasure is your reason for living. You may derive pleasure from any number of sources: sex, drugs, food, sensory stimulus of any kind. Choose one or all of the above. You spend most of your time and resources in pursuit of the vice of your choice, despite the pain that often accompanies it. More than the Bon Vivant, who simply denies reality with pleasure, you dive full-force into vice with the hopes that it will bring you enlightenment and power. While the Bon-Vivant is happy as long as he is enjoying himself, you want more, always skating the edge for your next thrill. Your appetite for pleasure is constantly increasing. You require ever more stimuli to satiate your jaded palate.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you spend a day pursuing one of your vices, or experience a completely new pleasurable sensation.
Ban: Never turn down an opportunity to fulfill your desires.`;
