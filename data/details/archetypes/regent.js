export const label = "Regent"

export const description = `Nobility in the purest sense, you are the ruler, the patriarch or matriarch. You are the judge and legislator who sorts right from wrong. More than any other, you feel the heavy burden of duty and obligation. Often, you have to deal our punishment. Although you despise it, it is a necessary part of your responsibilities, and you perform it with as much wisdom and fairness as you can muster. You have resigned yourself to the fact that regency is a lonely and often misunderstood mission, and you do not let your personal feelings interfere with the charge of your station.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever you resolve a situation through the strength of your leadership.
Ban: Never compromise or shirk your duty or the laws by which you live, whatever they may be.`;
