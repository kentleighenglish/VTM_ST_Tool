export const label = "Architect"

export const description = `Your sense of purpose goes beyond your own needs; you try to create something of lasting value for those who will come after you. People need many things, and you gain satisfaction by providing whatever you can. You are the type of person who makes an effort to build something of value: to found a town, create a company or in some way leave a lasting legacy. Many American pioneers were Architects by Nature.
Quest: Whenever you create or establish something of importance or lasting value, you gain a Willpower.
Ban: Never work towards a goal that will destroy something that someone has put their time and effort into. You may only improve on it.`;
