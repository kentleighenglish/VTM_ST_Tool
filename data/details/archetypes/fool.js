export const label = "Fool"

export const description = `You are the divine trickster, the clown, the one who laughs last and loudest. Because you believe that there is no meaning in the world, no underlying reason for anything, you take great pleasure in spoiling people's well-laid plans by sticking the proverbial monkey-wrench in the works. You almost feel it a duty to play the agent of chaos, knocking others off their pedestals of dogma and making them eat their spouted words of honor and nobility. Sometimes you work for weeks, months, or even years formulating your pranks, laying the foundation, and setting the trap so that when your prey steps into it, they fall all the harder.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you manage to deflate the ego of someone you have labeled as self-righteous.
Ban: Never search for the "whys" behind your life; there are none.`;
