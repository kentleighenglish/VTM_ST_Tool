export const label = "Hoarder"

export const description = `You have determined that you will never lack for anything. You amass great quantities of whatever you feel you needâ€“ food, wealth, followers. The idea of sharing anything is foreign to you; let others provide for themselves. You never know when there will be a shortage of something essential for survival, and you will not risk being caught empty-handed. In this age of coming Winter, you spend your days preparing for the hard times.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever your hoarding instinct pays off, particularly when others are in need but you are still provided for.
Ban: Never willingly surrender anything you have gained for yourself.`;
