export const label = "Penitent"

export const description = `You exist to atone for a grave sin you have committed, or feel that you committed. You have either a low self-esteem or a legitimate, traumatic past, and you feel compelled to "make up" for your previous actions. You are not necessarily religious; you may simply wish to scourge the world of the grief that you bring to it. You feel remorse for your actions of the past, or perhaps even actions you continue to commit, and are conflicted about how to atone for these crimes. As such, you do not let yourself rest easily, living a life of constant contrition, avoiding creature comforts, and seeking some answer for your existence.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you fully atone for something you have done wrong (or perceive as something you've done wrong), on an equal magnitude of atonement for crime.
Ban: Never let yourself become too comfortable. Never praise yourself or accept praise.`;
