export const description = `Manners are for wimps, wusses, and mama's boys. Urrrrp! Rude and ill-bred, you scoff (and piss, and belch) at convention. Polite society is just a bunch of snobs with something up their butts and even more to hide. Unlike the Grotesque, you are not necessarily trying to be disgusting; you just think that the societal strictures governing personal comportment are unnecessary. You areâ€¦ natural.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you get away with outraging polite society.
Ban: Never be polite.`;
