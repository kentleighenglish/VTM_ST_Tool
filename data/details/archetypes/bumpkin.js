export const description = `Solid and practical, you approach every problem with common sense and pragmatism. You bring the conversation back to the point and ask the questions that get the right answers. Always prepared, you think about possible scenarios in advance and take precautions against them, or else are more than willing to use whatever's around to solve the matter. You love solving problems, both your own and those of others. You become frustrated with people who don't seem to think quite as logically as you.
Quest: Whenever you successfully apply a practical, homespun solution to any problem, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never miss an opportunity to solve a problem through practical application of logic and common sense.`;
