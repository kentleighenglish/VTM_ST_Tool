export const label = "Wayfarer"

export const description = `Your story is that of the endless wanderer, the great explorer and adventurer who has a love in every port and rarely stays in any one place for long. You live by your own wits, though your restless nature often lands you in dangerous situations. A reactionary, you act first and think later. This sometimes saves you; other times, it gets you in trouble. Impatient and easily bored, you are always looking for the next adventure.
Quest: Whenever you survive a life-threatening scene through your own cleverness, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never plan for the future.`;
