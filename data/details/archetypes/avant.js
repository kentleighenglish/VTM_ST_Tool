export const description = `You must always be in the forefront - always the first with a piece of news, a dance or fashion trend, or a discovery in the arts. Nothing pains you more than hearing news secondhand, or someone else telling you about a hot new band. New discoveries are your life, and you devote a great deal of time and effort to keeping up with things. After all, if you're not in the forefront, you're nowhere.
Quest: Whenever you are the first with a piece of news or some other significant discovery, you regain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never allow distraction to sway you from your course, when you know that a piece of fresh news might be at stake.`;
