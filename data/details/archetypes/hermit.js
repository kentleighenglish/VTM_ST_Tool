export const label = "Hermit"

export const description = `You are reclusive and ascetic by nature, preferring your own company to that of others. Introspective by nature, you view everything from a very personal standpoint. When in public, you tend to be quiet, speaking only when spoken to, unless your input has such extreme relevance that you feel that you have to say it. One of the benefits of this is that others tend to see you as wise, since when you do speak, your words often make a profound point that was overlooked. Despite your desire to be alone, you are drawn out by the need to watch and learn. Your curiosity about the nature of things and your place among them keeps you from being totally isolated.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever you find a solution to a problem through inner reflection rather than brash action.
Ban: Rarely speak unless the situation is dire and you feel that your viewpoint has not already been expressed.`;
