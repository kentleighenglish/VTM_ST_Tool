export const label = "Weird"

export const description = `You cultivate an aura of power and mystery similar to the Riddler, but you are more concerned with being held in high regard. You are the strange one, the medium, the truthsayer and the seer whose powers are unfathomable to others. You may study the magic, methods of soothsaying, or even the ways of the dead, but this is always to the maximum effect on others around you. Your objective is to convince them that you are a dangerous, implacable sorcerer, someone who is to be feared and revered. You delight in being held at arm's length by anyone you consider "common" and are unlikely to associate with anyone who can reveal the nature of your powers or source of wisdom. You hold yourself above all others, and expect the same from everyone else.
Quest: Whenever you convince others that they do not, cannot possibly understand you and your powers, gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never submit to being "one of the crowd." Never let anyone condescend to you.`;
