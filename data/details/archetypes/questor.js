export const description = `The Questor seeks to find the one great answer that will make sense of the world. With so much suffering and confusion all around her, the Questor wants simply to understand. The Questor attempts to boil down all quandries and dilemmas to their root conflicts and simplify all relationships into something digestible, manageable and surmountable. The Questor seldom feels at rest and may quietly believe that happiness can come only with an utter understanding of the world. Clergymen, scientists, contemplatives and spiritualists fulfill the Questor Archetype.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you reach some concise life lesson that could become a rule of thumb. This rule is inevitable disproved, but it's just answers you seek, after all, not necessarily the truth.
Ban: Avoiding a chance to find answers/life lessons.`;
