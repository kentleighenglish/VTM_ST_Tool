export const description = `You like to push the boundaries other others and try to see how much they can take - how much pain they can tolerate before they collapse. You gain a certain satisfaction from causing or observing suffering, humiliation, deprivation and even mutilation, especially when you are the cause of said pain and have control over it. You know that your need is somewhat perverse, but you know you aren't crazy. This is just the way you are.
Quest: Regain two points of Willpower whenever you bring suffering in a new way.
Ban: Refusing a chance to make another suffer or alleviating another of pain.`;
