export const label = "Outlaw"

export const description = `You look out at the world and see an ocean of mindless automatons that haven't the slightest clue as to what it's all about. You believe it's your duty to take advantage of them. How else are they going to learn? A thief and a cad, you take what you want from others without a moment's hesitation and guilt. If your victims are stupid enough to be victims, then you see no reason not to use and abuse them. You feel no pity for peopleâ€“ they've made their own beds, and now they can lie in them.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you commit a completely selfish that hurts someone.
Ban: Never do anything that helps others more than it hurts them or helps you, in the long run.`;
