export const label = "Gadfly"

export const description = `Someone has to keep the powers-that-be honest. It might as well be you. No one is 100% right, and you always take great pleasure in pointing this out to everyone. Unlike the Humbug, you generally mean for your criticism to be helpful, though some still find it annoying. You especially criticize those in positions of power. You are persistent in your task, and no explanation is enough to completely mollify you. Even if everything happened exactly the way that you wanted it to, you would soon find something new to criticize.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower every time you win an argument with someone in power.
Ban: Never let anyone get the last word.`;
