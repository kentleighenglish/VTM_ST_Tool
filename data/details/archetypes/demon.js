export const label = "Demon-Lover"

export const description = `Others see you as a lover of pleasure and a consummate hedonist, but you want more. You like to take risks, and it secretly delights you when others can't keep up with them. You want more, always, and damn the expense. You also want others to know about it; you pursue pleasure as much for the rights to brag about it as the pleasure itself. You always kiss and tell, and delight when your exploits become the talk of the town. Though some may say that you are crass, you go out of your way to make yourself an object of envy and desire. You have a reputation to protect as a ferocious and insatiable pleasure-seeker, and you'll do anything to protect it.
Quest: Whenever you prove that you are the most extreme person, and that others cannot keep up with your appetites, you gain Willpower.
Ban: Never resist an opportunity to push things beyond acceptable limits.`;
