export const description = `Your enlightenment draws others to you. You may be a mentor of a particular Path of Enlightenment, a priest with the church, or merely an idealist in your pack. Whatever the case, your presence motivates and moves others to engage in spiritual or ideological pursuits. Your peers view you as calm, centered, and “with it,” even when you are preaching a bout violence as a means to an end.
Quest: Gain back a WP whenever someone heeds wisdom that you imparted.
Ban: Never betray a chance to mentor your comrades.`;
