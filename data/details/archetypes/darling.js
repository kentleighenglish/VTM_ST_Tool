export const description = `You are the apple of everyone's eye, the precious, delicate creature that simply must be taken care of, treated with excessive caution and babied. You could be ignorant of the world, and thus a true innocent, genuinely weak-willed and weak-minded, requiring the need for care from others and possessing the charm to earn it, or manipulative and cunning, using what charms you may have to attain what you desire.
Quest: Regain a WP whenever the character is treated with unusual kindness, favoritism or consideration.
Ban: Never show the fact that you are, or can be, independent. Others must feel you need them.`;
