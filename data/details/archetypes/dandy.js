export const label = "Dandy"

export const description = `A social climber at heart, you are an expert on court etiquette. Your goal is to get as high up the ladder as possible. Intrigue and gossip feed you, and you can always be found at the periphery of trouble, watching and listening to see what you can learn and possible use for your own benefit at a later time. Somewhat of a snob, you look back down the ladder with disdain, especially at those who might take your position from you. However, you know better than to burden your bridges. As a result, you tend to play the diplomat. You will do anything to make yourself look good, often helping others and taking risks in order to do so.
Quest: Whenever you succeed in strengthening your hold on your current social position or in getting a promotion, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never miss an opportunity to ingratiate yourself to one of your superiors.`;
