export const label = "Outcast"

export const description = `You are a loner, a drifter on the outskirts of society, and you can ultimately only rely on yourself. You've seen the way that other, "civilized" beings betray and plot against each other, and you want none of it. Friends are just people who'll eventually use you, and every love eventually fades, and leaves you more empty for it. You are a bitter pessimist who feels failed by others, and withdraws as a result.
Quest: Whenever you prove that you do not need anyone or anything to survive, regain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never permanently associate yourself with any group or individual.`;
