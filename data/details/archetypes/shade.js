export const description = `Like the Pishogue, you see the world in a very different way than most. Unfortunately, it is a very ugly place. You are a human zombie, an emotional sleepwalker who sees the world as a never-ending horror show. The World of Darkness has finally gotten to you. You accept mindless brutality as the natural order of things. Perhaps you react to this reality by joining in the mayhem, or perhaps you've retreated behind a wall of emotionless detachment. This is not to say that you have no sense of moral outrage, it just takes the most inhuman of atrocities to even register on your screen. Your primary motivations are selfish desire and immediate personal gratification.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you encounter a horrific experience without betraying emotion.
Ban: Never show an extreme emotion, even in crisis situations.`;
