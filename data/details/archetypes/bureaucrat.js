export const description = `Laws were created for a reason, and you have to be sure to follow them. Rules weren't made to be broken. Even mankind's laws aren't as easy to forget as some people might hope. You must follow the rules to a "T." If nobody follows the laws, civilization breaks down into chaos, and no one in their right mind wants that. Others probably see you as stodgy and hidebound.
Quest: Whenever you solve a situation "by the book," and can get others to follow correct procedures, you gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never willingly permit the laws and traditions to be broken, though you might accompany those who did so, if only to point out their mistakes.`;
