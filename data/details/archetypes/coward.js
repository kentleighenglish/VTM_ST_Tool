export const label = "Coward"

export const description = `The Coward fears himself above all. Whatever it is at the heart of the Coward cannot be revealed, or he will be vulnerable to attack or rejection. This utter separation from the outside world is terrifying, thus the Coward reveals morsels of his thoughts and feelings in hopes of love and approval. The Coward longs to be validated and accepted. Persons who seek out anonymous positions in the clergy or in military and industrial sectors are often of the Coward Archetype.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you reveal something about yourself without being hurt or utterly revealed.
Ban: Never take unnecessary risks or actions that may cause you hurt or problems.`;
