export const description = `Why work for something, when you can trick somebody else into getting it for you? You always try to find the easy way, the fast track to success and wealth. Some people call you a thief, a swindler, or less pleasant terms, but you know that everybody in the world would do unto you if they could. You just do it first, and better. You might be a criminal, but you probably see yourself merely as an entrepreneur, making good for yourself at the expense of fools. Why put yourself out when there are so many saps?
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you trick someone into doing something for you, without having to do work.
Ban: Never lift a finger if there's someone else who could do it for you.`;
