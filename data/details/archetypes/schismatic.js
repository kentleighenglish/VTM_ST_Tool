export const label = "Schismatic"

export const description = `Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. You are a destroyer of social institutions, be they governments, businesses, or families. You never miss an opportunity to sow dissention or cause discord. Maybe you do this to help people break out of old, hidebound ways of doing things, but you mostly just enjoy destroying things that other people build. It's a dog-eat-dog world out there. The sooner the huddled masses are on their own, the sooner they will realize that. You view yourself as a bold social visionary, an anarchist or a rugged individualist. This may be true, or you may just be a destructive child.
Quest: Gain Willpower every time you cause dissention in a tightly-knit group.
Ban: Never join a formal organization, except for the express purpose of disrupting it or using it to disrupt other organizations.`;
