export const label = "Prankster"

export const description = `The quintessential pooka, you delight in the playing all manner of jokes and pranks. You do this for any number of reasons. You may merely want to amuse people, or you may be trying to show people that they take themselves much too seriously. The pranks you play may be as simple as a pie in the face, or as elaborate as a royal family tree. These pranks are rarely harmful or done out of spite, and usually result in no more than a few bruises or some personal embarrassment.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower every time you pull off a particularly artful prank.
Ban: Never verbally apologize for a prank (indirect acts of contrition are possible). Never take anything too seriously.`;
