export const label = "Director"

export const description = `Nothing is worse than chaos and disorder, and it creeps in at a moment's notice. You seek to be in charge, not for the sake of your own power, but simply to keep everything running smoothly. You are perfectly willing to take a subordinate position, even to be rarely or never praised, if you could only make things more orderly and efficient. Alternately, you may see other leaders as a source of the problem, and demand a more central role in the structure of whatever organizations you belong to. You often have inventive new ways of doing things, but these innovations may get in the way of others and their habits.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you get a group to do something in a well-organized and efficient way.
Ban: Never miss an opportunity to inspect how things are done, and throw in your own two cents on the matter.`;
