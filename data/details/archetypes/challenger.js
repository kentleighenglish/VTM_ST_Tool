export const label = "Challenger"

export const description = `You exist to test the mettle of others, especially your so-called betters. You realize that most of the time, people pretend to be something that they're not to get what they want. Similarly, a lot of potential goes untapped because no one is willing to challenge themselves, and test their strength. That's where you come in. You see yourself as providing an invaluable service to the individuals and societies around you, by forcing them to realize their true strengths and capabilities. It's important to take the poseurs down a notch, and it gives you a chance to figure out where you fit into the hierarchy, as well. You're not willing to accept anything at face value; you don't have to be overt, but you're always looking for a chance to size others up.
Quest: Gain Willpower whenever you expose the weakness of others through direct confrontation, especially those who claimed to be something they weren't. Similarly, you gain Willpower whenever you prove to someone that they were stronger than they thought.
Ban: Never resist an opportunity to size someone up, man to man. Never trust someone until you've tested their mettle personally.`;
