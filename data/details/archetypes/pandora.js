export const label = "Pandora"

export const description = `Like Pandora, you just can't seem to keep your box shut. You open your mouth, and trouble flows from it in great crashing waves. You just can't help yourself. You love to get someone in trouble by revealing their secrets for them. Furthermore, your curiosity often overcomes you, especially if you have been forbidden to go somewhere or do something. The more someone insists that you shouldn't do something, the more it makes you want to do exactly that.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever you survive something dangerous that you were strictly forbidden to do or warned against.
Ban: Never keep a secret; never obey an order.`;
