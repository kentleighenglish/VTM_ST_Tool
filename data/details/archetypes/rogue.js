export const label = "Rogue"

export const description = `You don't need to work; so many others out there can get the job done for you. Others see you as a leech, but while they're licking their wounds, and cleaning their boots, you're spending your share of the pot. All things considered, you prefer taking the path of least resistance. There's always some gung-ho hero ready to leap to the fore and do all the dirty work. Why not let him? And so what if you're there with your hand out when it's time to reap the reward. You didn't ask that guy to do it; you just didn't offer to help.
Quest: Whenever you achieve something that you do not really deserve, regain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never work for something when it can be had for free.`;
