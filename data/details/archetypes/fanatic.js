export const label = "Fanatic"

export const description = `You have a purpose, and that purpose consumes your existence. You pour yourself into your cause; indeed, you may feel guilty for undertaking any objective that deviates from your higher goal. To you, the end justifies the meansâ€“ the cause is more important than those who serve it. Whatever your cause, you'll stop at nothing to achieve it, and woe betide those who stand in your way. You consider it the highest goal to convert others to your cause, bringing them to your way of thinking, and adding them to your forces.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you convert others to your cause, or get them to step out of your way because of your zeal.
Ban: Never keep your ideals to yourself; never resist an opportunity to bring others into the fold.`;
