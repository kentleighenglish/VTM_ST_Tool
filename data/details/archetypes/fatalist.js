export const label = "Fatalist"

export const description = `Like Pooh's companion, Eeyore, you have a less-than-optimistic view of the world. You expect things to go wrong, and you take a dark and sullen pleasure when you're proven right. Because everything is doomed to end disastrously, there is no reason to struggle. You have no hope for a bright future, but rather are resigned to inevitable gloom. You find comfort in your pessimism, because you know you'll never be disappointed. Even when things turn out to have a happy ending, you know that it's only a temporary illusion and the real disaster is undoubtedly following right behind.
Quest: Regain Willpower when your warnings of doom turn out to be correct.
Ban: Never laugh except in bitterness and sarcasm.`;
