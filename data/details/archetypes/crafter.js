export const description = `The urge to improve things burns strong within you. You see everything in terms of what you can do to make it better. Nothing brings you greater joy than creating something beautiful or useful out of the ugly or useless. You are never without a project of some sort, whether it is a painting, a sculpture, an organization, or the training and molding of a less-than-perfect individual. You enjoy the process, but can't wait to see the finished product.
Quest: Whenever you create something of lasting value, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never miss an opportunity to put your touch on something and improve it in some way.`;
