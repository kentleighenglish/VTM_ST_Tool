export const label = "Deviant"

export const description = `There are always people who don't fit in, and you are such a miscreant. Your beliefs, motivations and sense of propriety are the complete antithesis of the status quo. You are not so much an aimless rebel as an independent thinker who does not belong in the society in which you were raised. You don't give a damn about other people's morality, but you do adhere to your own strange code of conduct. Deviants are typically irreverent, and some have truly bizarre tastes and desires.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you are able to thumb your nose at society and its precepts without retaliation.
Ban: Never side with the status quo.`;
