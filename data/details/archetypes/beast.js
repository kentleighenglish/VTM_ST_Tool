export const label = "Beast"

export const description = `You seek to conquer all who oppose you, destroying them if possible. Your world view is defined by those who bow to you and those who get eaten because they didn't. To you, all exists at and for your pleasure. You play people off each other, like chess pieces on a board, with no consideration for anyone's needs but your own. You take what you want without asking, and you destroy those weaker than yourself for amusement.
Quest: Whenever you remove significant opposition to your goals, gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never retreat; never compromise your territory.`;
