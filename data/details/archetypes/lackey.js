export const description = `You are a servile minion, drawing strength from those you serve. Perhaps you are a coward at heart, or you fear having to take responsibility for your own actions, and instead abuse the powers of others. Whatever the reason, you attach yourself to the most powerful person who will permit it, and covet their praise. Even their discipline means that they notice you, and if your ego isn't stroked on a regular basis, you're likely to misbehave simply to draw their attention again. You think for yourself as little as possible, and though you have some enlightened interest in the goals of your master, you're willing to do absolutely anything to achieve those goals. Others call you a boot-lick, a spy, or a mercenary, depending upon how they got to know you.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you receive praise, or even attentive discipline, from a superior.
Ban: Never think for yourself when the orders of others will suffice.`;
