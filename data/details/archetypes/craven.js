export const description = `Better a live coward than a dead hero. You live your life by those words. Unfortunately, this does not just mean that you have the good sense to avoid harrowing situations. You are a true coward in almost every area of your life. Your code applies to social situations and facing unpleasant truths about yourself, as well as avoiding physical danger. While you may put yourself in danger, you are always looking for the nearest escape route. You may be ashamed of your cowardice and occasionally perform heroic or bullying acts out of a need to prove yourself.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you save yourself by running away.
Ban: Never volunteer for dangerous assignments.`;
