export const label = "Sophist"

export const description = `Most people are hungry for knowledge, whether they know it or not. You are more than happy to share yours, for a price. You are a sophist in the old sense of the word, one who teaches solely for self-gain. Is that so wrong? Unfortunately, you just assume that people want what you are selling. When the ungrateful fools don't meet your price you becomeâ€¦ agitated. You believe you know more than everyone else. You will rarely back down from your original argument, no matter how much sophistry and facile logic you have to employ to convince everybody that you know best.
Quest: Gain Willpower every time you win an argument or debate.
Ban: Never admit you are wrong.`;
