export const label = "Diplomat"

export const description = `The world is full of people who'd rather be right than have peace, firebrands who think with their tempers and not their brains. Someone has to try and get the parties involved to sit down and actually listen, and who better than you? You are patient, compassionate, and see all sides of the issue. Long after others would have tired of diplomacy, you remain the fair arbiter, neutral to the demands of others, willing to make peace but not at the expense of the rights of others. You may be calm, harried, pleading or stern, using a wide variety of tactics to suit your audience, but you can tailor your message to what people want to hear. Unlike the Courtier, you do not exist merely to please; you have a sense of what is right and just that drives you, and that won't let you settle for an agreement wherein one side has leverage over another.
Quest: Whenever you can bring people of disparate viewpoints to a mutually beneficial agreement, or at least keep the peace between them, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never make a decision without hearing all sides of the issue.`;
