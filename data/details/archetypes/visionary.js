export const label = "Visionary"

export const description = `You are strong enough to look beyond the mundane and see the truly wondrous. You test accepted social limits and question authority not to destroy the old order, but to bring the dream to realization. You often question what others could be doing, as opposed to what they are doing. Wide-eyed but hardly naive, you possess a charisma and a vision which may either threaten others or draw them to you, depending upon their feelings about tradition and the changes you wish to enact.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower every time you are able to convince others to have faith in your dreams and follow the course of action dictated by your vision.
Ban: Never resist an opportunity to explain your vision to others, or correct a flawed system to correspond with your dream of the world remade.`;
