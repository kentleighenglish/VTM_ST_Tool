export const label = "Bon Vivant"

export const description = `You know that life is shallow and meaningless. As such, you decide to enjoy your time on Earth, because who knows what comes afterwards? You're not necessarily irresponsible; rather, you are simple predisposed to having a good time along the way, even if its at the expense of others. You know that once the music stops, you'll have to face the real world, and its simply too painful to focus on for long. Instead, you throw yourself into blissful denial, attending to your own pleasure rather than the cold, hard facts of life. Hedonists, sybarites, and dilettantes are all examples of this archetype.
Quest: Whenever you manage to enjoy yourself despite a bad situation, or because of it, you gain Willpower.
Ban: Never let the party end, even when it is long over, and everyone wants to go home.`;
