export const label = "Bravo"

export const description = `You are known as a bully, a ruffian and a tough, and delight in tormenting the weak. Things must always go your way, and you do not tolerate those who cross you. Power and might are all you respect; indeed, you heed only those who can prove their power to you. You see nothing wrong with forcing your will upon others. There is nothing you like better than to persecute, antagonize, heckle and intimidate those for whom you have contempt - and of them there are many. The emotions of kindness and pity are not completely foreign to you, but you hide from your own sense of weakness through cruelty to others. While most Bravos despise the weak, a few become their protectors.
Quest: When you intimidate or physically force another person to do what you wish, gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never let another person get away with giving you 'No' for an answer. It just isn't acceptable.`;
