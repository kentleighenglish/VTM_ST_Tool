export const description = `The Trickster finds the absurd in everything. No matter how grim life or unlife may become, the Trickster always uncovers a kernel of humor within it. Tricksters cannot abide sorrow or pain, and so they strive to lighten the spirits of those around them. Some Tricksters have even higher ideals, challenging static dogma by exposing its failures in humorous ways. Comedians, satirists and social critics are examples of Trickster Archetypes.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower any time you manage to lift others' spirits, especially if you are able to deny your own pain in the process.
Ban: Submitting to a serious life, submitting to sorrow/pain and embracing negativity.`;
