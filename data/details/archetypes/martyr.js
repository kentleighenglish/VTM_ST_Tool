export const label = "Martyr"

export const description = `You suffer for your cause, enduring trials out of the belief that your suffering will ultimately improve the lot of others. You may want the attention or sympathy that your ordeals engender, or you may actually be sincere in your cause, greeting the opposition with unfaltering faith in your beliefs. You are the first to throw yourself between harm and your friends, knowing that your sacrifice will serve to shelter them.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you sacrifice yourself or your comfort for your ideals or another's immediate gain.
Ban: Never indulge in what could be given away instead; never accept gifts or comfort when there are others who could use them instead.`;
