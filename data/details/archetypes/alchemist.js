export const label = "Alchemist"

export const description = `"As above, so belowâ€¦" runs the alchemical axiom, and you believe it. There is more to be learned in the lab and the library than anywhere else, and the results are so much clearer in those venues. You are a student of the mysteries, a dabbler into metasciences, and an explorer of forgotten lore. What's more, you believe that the answers to everyday problems, both mundane and esoteric, are found in the operations that one performs magically. You are rational and methodical, relying on careful consideration and an implicit (if not entirely consistent) logic.
Quest: Whenever a breakthrough gives you a greater understanding of the magical axioms which allow supernaturals to function, you gain Willpower.
Ban: Never participate in social games or other "distractions" when there is work to be done in the lab.`;
