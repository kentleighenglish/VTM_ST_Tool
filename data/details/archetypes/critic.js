export const label = "Critic"

export const description = `Nothing in the world should be accepted without thorough scrutiny and examination. Nothing is ever perfect, and the blemishes must be pointed out in order for the good to be truly known. Your standards are high for everything, and you insist on their being met. You encourage the same ideals in others, because laxity and low standards reduce the quality of life for everyone. Others will thank you later, once they discover the purity of your perspective. You seek out and expose the imperfections in every person or thing you encounter. You are never satisfied with anything that is less than perfect, unless it is within yourself after all, you're not a perfectionist.
Quest: Regain one Willpower point whenever you are able to discover a significant imperfection that has escaped the attention of others.
Ban: Lowering your high standards or refusing to critic something flawed.`;
