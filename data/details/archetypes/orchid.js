export const description = `Up until now, you have lived a pampered, protected life. Suddenly, you have been forced out into the light and faced with the harsh realities of the world. You find it difficult to trust anyone, and yet you fervently wish for someone to come along and take care of you. You have no experience dealing with the dangers and hurts of the real world. Wide-eyed and innocent, each new disaster threatens to shatter your world. You let others make your decisions for you, not out of preference, but rather as a result of the insecurity you feel when faced with problems.
Quest: Whenever you escape a frightening situation with your sense of well-being and innocence intact, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never trust a stranger; never reveal yourself to anyone.`;
