export const label = "Masochist"

export const description = `You love to test your limits, and see how much pain you can tolerate before you collapse. While this may accidentally cause you to commit heroic actions, you're doing this entirely for yourself, and the secret delight you get from your own suffering. You gain satisfaction from humiliation, suffering, denial, and even physical pain. You define who you are by your ability to feel discomfortâ€“ you wake each day only to greet a new pain. Your twisted ambitions are likely to freak out others, but you find release only in agony. You may even seek to indoctrinate others into your philosophy, but you are not a sadist; your involvement is entirely in your own pain.
Quest: Whenever you experience a new pain, or when the situation turns against you through your own design, you gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never resist an opportunity to torture yourself, both physically and emotionally.`;
