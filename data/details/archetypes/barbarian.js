export const label = "Barbarian"

export const description = `Civilization is the trap that the clever set for the weak, and in which they end up snaring themselves. Truly intelligent, brave, strong people understand that sedentary existence only brings you that much closer to the grave, and that what counts is what you achieve as an individual. You respect only actual deeds. Anyone can boast or scheme, but all words vanish in the end. Only deeds remain, having changed the world.
Quest: When you beat 'civilized' competition through your barbaric virtues, gain back a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never embrace the concepts of civilization as a means to an end.`;
