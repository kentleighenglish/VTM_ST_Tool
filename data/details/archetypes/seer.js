export const description = `Someone has to plumb the mysteries of the world, for the good of others. You exemplify that role, carefully gathering all the information you can through natural and supernatural methods so that you can play the role of advisor and soothsayer. You pride yourself on the ability to ferret out the truth, the best path, and the answers, though you know that sometimes they will shock and terrify people. Still, you must gain whatever insight you can; to live in darkness is not to live at all. Whenever you can, you use supernatural methods to divine the best course of action, whether that is an innate gift you possess or communication with the spirit world.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever others act on your advice, especially that gained through supernatural means.
Ban: Never undertake any major course of action, or let any of your friends do the same, without at least a serious attempt to divine the future.`;
