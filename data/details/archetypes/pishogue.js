export const description = `You interpret reality very differently than everyone else, but in a benign fashion. The world is a place of endless, childlike wonder to you. Even the most destitute places seem like storybook palaces. You are an eternal ingenue, and your world view makes you generally very trusting of others. This does not necessarily mean that you are easy to manipulate, however. Because of your strange mental state, you are easily distracted, but you may also notice things that other people miss. You tend to be highly creative.
Quest: Regain Willpower every time you avoid a particularly unpleasant truth.
Ban: Never take anything too seriously.`;
