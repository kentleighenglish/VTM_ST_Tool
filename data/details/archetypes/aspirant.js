export const description = `Life is a learning experience, and you always strive to improve yourself. Every obstacle is a potential opportunity, and you rarely rest on the laurels of past accomplishments for very long. This means that you spend most of your time pursuing different goals. Unlike the Virtuoso, your aspirations tend towards gaining general excellence, rather than mastering one particular field. You view the pursuit of a goal to be just as important as obtaining it. As a result, others may see you as a jack-of-all-trades but a true master of none, someone who abandons projects once he becomes bored with them. The challenge of learning the new thing is what interests you, so your accomplishments are likely to be diverse, but not entirely noteworthy.
Quest: Gain Willpower every time you overcome an obstacle.
Ban: Never pass up a learning opportunity.`;
