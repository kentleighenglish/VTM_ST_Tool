export const label = "Gallant"

export const description = `You are as flamboyant as you are amoral; some see you as a rogue, a Don Juan, a rake, a paramour or just a lounge lizard - but you see yourself as all of the above. A consummate actor who loves to make as big a show of things as possible, nothing attracts your attention more than an appreciative audience. You love people and you love to impress them even more. Though you may indeed be a superior lover, you enjoy the chase almost as much as you enjoy the act. Gallants vary widely in temperament and ambition, holding in common little more than their love of attention.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you manage to dazzle or impress another person. The Storyteller is always the judge, even when characters are involved.
Ban: Never refuse an attempt to promote your image.`;
