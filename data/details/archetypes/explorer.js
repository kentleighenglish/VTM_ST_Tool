export const label = "Explorer"

export const description = `There is a whole world out there and no one really knows the first thing about it. You are only truly content when you are blazing a path into new territories, finding what's out there and bringing back news of it to others. You take risks so that others don't have to, but you also enjoy the thrill of putting yourself in the way of possible danger. At the same time, you know when it's best to act as an observer, and you have learned to move quietly when it is necessary. You may be excited or fearful of the great unknown, but, no matter what, you cannot resist its call.
Quest: Whenever you successfully explore new territory, find something that no one has ever seen before, or find a solution that no one else thought of, you gain Willpower.
Ban: Never pass an opportunity to be the first to discover something new. Never resist an opportunity to share your findings with others.`;
