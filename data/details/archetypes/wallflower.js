export const description = `You are shy, and feel that your best place is hanging back when social grace or heroism are called for. Nonetheless, you are always attentive, paying attention for the chance to do your part. You keep to the wings, watching carefully, and making notes as to who is up to what. You don't feel you will ever shine, but you might be able to do your part to help others. Nonetheless, you resist anyone who tries to draw you out too much, retreating to the shadows where it's safe. Unlike the Lurker, you aren't quick to cut yourself off for the sake of your own skin, and may secretly befriend others, so long as it doesn't force you into the limelight.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you learn a juicy secret or important piece of information by holding your tongue and paying attention.
Ban: Never make a scene, or speak up when you think your opinions aren't wanted. Never volunteer information without prompting.`;
