export const description = `You love to see other people happy, and do whatever you can to encourage them, whether through playing matchmaker or refilling a drink. Perhaps you live vicariously through their experiences, or perhaps you just feel that others sometimes need a little push from you to find their fulfillment. You spend more tome on this than you do pursuing your own interests and gain great pleasure from it. A skilled manipulator, you work most of your magic from behind the scenes, dropping hints or subtle encouragement.
Quest: You regain Willpower whenever you cause someone else's happiness or fun without them realizing your part in it.
Ban: Never do anything that you know would undermine another's happiness.`;
