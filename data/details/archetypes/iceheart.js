export const label = "Iceheart"

export const description = `You are the Ice Queen, the detached and cold pragmatist. It's too dangerous to get involved with anything emotionally, though you don't necessarily tell others that. Some see you as jaded or frigid, but you are the unmoving rock that others can rely on. The screams of your victims, the desperate pleas of abandoned lovers, the groveling of courtiers, all are met with an icy facade. Your face is a permanent mask of vague disinterest, and you perfect the art of the bored stare. You delight in exposing the weakness of the emotionally vulnerable; in your spare time, you are likely to take many lovers, and abandon them for the pleasure of watching their weakness. Still waters run deep, of course; you have likely been hurt to reduce you to this, and a sea of emotional wreckage lurks beneath the ice of your demeanor.
Quest: Whenever you win the day as a result of being unaffected by the attempts of others to sway your emotions, you gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never betray the true feelings of your heart; never let anyone know how you really feel.`;
