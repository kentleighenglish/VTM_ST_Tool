export const label = "Rebel"

export const description = `You are a malcontent, iconoclast and free-thinking recalcitrant. You are so independent-minded and free-willed that you are unwilling to join any particular cause or movement. You are just yourself and only desire the freedom to be yourself. You do not make a good follower and aren't usually a very good leader either (unless your followers are willing to go wherever you lead). You tend to be insubordinate to authority to the point of stupidity.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever your rebellion against the status quo turns out to be for the best.
Ban: Conforming to authority/Conforming to the status quo.`;
