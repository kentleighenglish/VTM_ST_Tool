export const label = "Mediator"

export const description = `The world is full of people who want things; sometimes people want the exact same thing. Some people have what other people want and would be willing to talk about working out a deal, but just don't know how to start. These people often have immense trouble finding and communicating with each other. That is where you come in. You are dedicated to mediating between people - fulfilling needs, smoothing over disputes, and generally helping people talk to one another. You are the diplomat, the middle child, the perpetual person in the middle.
Quest: Regain one point of Willpower whenever you are able to act as a go-between between two individuals or groups, and regain another point if you taring things to a satisfactory conclusion. The Storyteller may award more points for particularly outstanding mediation.
Ban: Never take one side in an arguement, always take a chance to be the third party, to be the diplomat.`;
