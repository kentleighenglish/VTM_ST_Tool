export const label = "Wildflower"

export const description = `You delight in the beauty of nature, the serene calm of harmony with the elements and the animals around you. Your idyllic view of nature may not always be true, but you live in a delightful dream of peace with your surroundings, taking only what you need and avoiding the excesses of modern civilization. In some ways, you are the counterpart of the Savage, but their cruel and barbaric ways have no place in your dream of harmony. You cultivate the wilderness around you, unafraid of being occasionally pricked by a thorn if it means you get to enjoy the beauty of a rose.
Quest: Gain a point of Willpower every time you show that the natural way is best, avoiding human artifice and technology for a more wild way of life.
Ban: Never let anyone threaten the beauty of the unspoiled wilderness, and nature itself.`;
