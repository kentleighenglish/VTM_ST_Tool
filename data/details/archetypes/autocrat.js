export const label = "Autocrat"

export const description = `It's your way or the highway. You want to be in charge, and seek prominence for its own sake, not necessarily because you have the organization's best interests at heart or have the best ideas, though certainly you think both of those things are true. You may genuinely believe that others are incompetent, but ultimately you crave power and control. You are likely to justify your authority through imagined or real threats, and though your leadership may be solid, you also brook no argument from those with equally valid alternate viewpoints.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you achieve control over a group or organization involving other individuals.
Ban: Never tolerate disobedience or disrespect.`;
