export const label = "Plotter"

export const description = `Everything you do is planned. Very little springs from you spontaneously. Your plans are often long and involved, sometimes extending beyond the lives of the mortals involved in them. Details must be exact, for you believe any deviation could bring ruin. You try to plan everything in your life; each thing you do must accomplish something in the greater scheme. Deviation from routine, however, is bothersome, not traumatic. You are organized, not deranged. You tend to be neat and precise in everything you do.
Quest: You regain three points of Willpower when one of your plots comes to fruition in the exact manner you planned.
Ban: Refuse to be spontaneous and avoid not planning.`;
