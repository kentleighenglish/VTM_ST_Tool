export const description = `There are few people who can say that they have mastered a given field, and you are one of them. You are a specialist, striving for excellence in a small number of related disciplines. Even if you have not yet reached the level of excellence that you desire, you consider yourself an authority (though you admit that you have more to learn). You fear all your attention toward learning more about your field of expertise.
Quest: Gain a point of Willpower every time you accomplish something that brings you closer to mastering your intended field of study.
Ban: Never become involved in tangential matters for too long.`;
