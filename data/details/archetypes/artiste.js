export const label = "Artiste"

export const description = `The Artiste is interested in art for art's sake. The ability to create is what elevates humans above the animals. The Masters knew this and rejoiced not just in the glory of human form, but in the gift of expression given only to humans. The Artiste thrives on the reception and digestion of her art â€” and usually the acceptance of it as well. Poets, playwrights, painters, composers and other such romantic demonstrative sorts are Artiste Archetypes. They can typically be found in Parisian and Budapest coffee or absinthe houses, university quads and dilapidated brothels or hostels serving as communes.
Quest: Whenever you manage to 'reach' an audience through something you've created, you gain a point of Willpower.
Ban: Never do something that would undermine a work of art. Your own or that of someone else.`;
