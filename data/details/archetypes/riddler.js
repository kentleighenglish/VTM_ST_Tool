export const label = "Riddler"

export const description = `You are an enigma, the mystery that no one can figure out. You are in love with secrets and never give a truly straight answer to any question. You obscure everything in double entendres, mysterious terms, and outright lies. You take joy in confusing and confounding others, satisfying your own need to feel that your intellect is superior to theirs. You are especially careful to shroud your own psyche in deepest mystery, and your greatest fear is that someone will learn what you're really like.
Quest: Whenever you manage to confuse or mislead someone, you regain Willpower.
Ban: Never allow others to discover the truth of you and your origins.`;
