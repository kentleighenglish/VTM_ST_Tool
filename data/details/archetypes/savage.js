export const label = "Savage"

export const description = `For you, the only viable way to live is like the animals in the forest, eating what you catch, mating when the urge strikes, and fighting to establish superiority. Everything else is senseless. Civilized conversation, etiquette, and technologyâ€“ wastes of time. Modern inventions only distract you from your true nature, and keep you form satisfying the instincts that burn in your soul. You long for a return to the days of primal self-indulgence and the law of nature. In the meantime, you just live your life as if they were already here, feral and proud of it.
Quest: Regain Willpower whenever you conquer "civilized" foes through your own cunning and might.
Ban: Never indulge in civilized folly.`;
