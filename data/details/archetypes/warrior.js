export const description = `Nothing seems more important than pitting your skill as a fighter against someone or something that threatens your pack, your kinfolk, or your duty to the grandmother. You live for battle and direct most of your attention to honing your mind and body into the perfect weapon. You delight in the thrill of combat and in the preparations and aftermath of war. You respect others for their fighting prowess and can appreciate a worthy opponent (except in the case of creatures who have no honor). You view other activities as less important or else you tend to see all actions as if they were tactics in a larger war.
â€“ Regain Willpower whenever you achieve a decisive victory in single combat with a foe that is at least your equal.`;
