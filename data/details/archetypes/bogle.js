export const label = "Bogle"

export const description = `You are a prankster at heart, and do not care who gets hurt as long as you get a good laugh out of it. Spiteful, mean-spirited pranks are your favorite, though you may occasionally play more benign ones. The results of your jokes usually range from the merely mean to the fatal. Like the Prankster, your jokes may range in intricacy, but motivations tend more towards spite and revenge.
Quest: Regain a point of Willpower whenever you pull off a particularly artful or mean-spirited prank.
Ban: Never apologize for a prank. Never let any intentional sleight from a human go by without a prank as repayment.`;
