export const label = "Poltroon"

export const description = `Meeting trouble (or anything else ) head-on is the tactic of fools and optimists. The sensible way to deal with trouble is to deny it a target. While some people might accuse you of sticking your head in the sand, they do have to admit that it has remained on your shoulders for quite some time, and looks like it will continue to do so indefinitely. You never confront what you can evade, and never face anything unless there is no other option. Courage is not high on your list of virtues, but then the line between courage and folly is virtually nonexistent to your eyes.
Quest: Regain one point of Willpower whenever you are able to avoid a problem or situation without dealing with it.
Ban: Avoid direct conflict.`;
