When a roll occurs that would result in your death, the roll is made again. If the next roll succeeds, then you live â€” and one of your nine lives is used up. If that subsequent roll fails, then another reroll is made, until either a successful roll occurs or your nine lives are used up. The Storyteller should keep careful count of how many lives the character has remaining.";
