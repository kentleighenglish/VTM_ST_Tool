Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex 2) are still able to use this ability, thought the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the otherhand, vampires who need make eye contact to enactpowers like Dominate against you are only at a penalty to do so (see the sidebar on p. 152).";
