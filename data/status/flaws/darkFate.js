export const description = "You are doomed to experience Final Death or, worse,suffer eternal agony. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this terrible fate. At some point during thechronicle, your Dark Fate will come upon you. Evenmore ghastly is the fact that you occasionally have visions of this fate, and the malaise these images inspirerequires an expenditure of a temporary Willpowerpoint to avoid, or else you lose a die from all of your actions for the remainder of the night. It is up to the Storyteller to determine the exact nature of this fate, andwhen it will occur. This is a difficult Flaw to roleplay;ironically, though it may seem as though it removesall free will, the knowledge of oneâ€™s death can be quiteliberating.";
