export const description = "You were created five or fewer years ago by a member of the Thirteenth Generation. Though you have10 blood points in your body, only eight of them maybe used to heal wounds, power Disciplines, raise Attributes, etc. You can still use the final two blood pointsfor other purposes, though. The blood point costs ofnightly rising, creating and sustaining ghouls, and creating blood bonds remains the same as for other vampires. You cannot raise any Discipline above four dots.Taking this Flaw precludes you from taking the Generation Background, and you may not start with Status,either. You are likely a Clanless Caitiff, for your bloodis probably too thin to pass down the distinguishingcharacteristics of a Clan. Most Fourteenth-Generation vampires should also take the Thin Blood Flaw";
