export const description = "Your vitae is so weak that only six of your 10 bloodpoints can be used for Disciplines, healing or raisingAttributes. For these functions, you must expend two blood points to obtain the effect a normal vampirewould achieve with one. (The cost for nightly risingremains a single blood point.) Whatâ€™s more, you cannot create or sustain ghouls, create a blood bond, orsire a vampiric childe. You can use the remaining fourblood points to survive through the day and wake up each night, nothing more. You cannot raise any Discipline above three dots. The weakening of the Curse of Caine has compensations, though (which distinguish this Flaw from the Thin Blood Flaw itself). Sunlight does lethal damage to you, instead of aggravated damage as it does to other vampires. You can hold down mortal food and drink for an hour or so; other vampires vomit immediately if they try (unless they have the Eat Food Merit). Strangest of all, once in a while you might actually have a child the normal, human way... though it will hardly be a normal, human child.";
