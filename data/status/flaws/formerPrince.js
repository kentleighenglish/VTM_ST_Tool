export const description = "Once, you held near-absolute power in a city, butthose nights are gone now. Perhaps you stepped down,perhaps you were deposed, or perhaps your city fellto the Sabbat; it matters little in your reduced state.What does matter is that the Prince in the city whereyou now dwell is aware of your prior employment, andhas concerns that you might be trying to make a comeback. The machinery of the Camarilla in the city whereyou now make your home is subtly stacked against you,and if the Prince sees an opportunity to get rid of youhe just might take it. This Flaw can only be taken byCamarilla vampires.";
