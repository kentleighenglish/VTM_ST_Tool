export const description = "You managed to make it through the Creation Rites or other similarly traumatic experience, but not wholly intact. The most insignificant thing can throw you into adifferent mood or state of mind, and as such your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your precariousemotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of each story, make a Willpower roll (you may notspend Willpower for an automatic success). If you succeed,you may participate in the story as normal. If you fail, however, your Willpower score is considered to be 1 for the duration of that session, and you only have one Willpowerpoint to spend. You may roll again at the beginning of thenext session to see if you regain your Willpower.";
